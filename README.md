#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineeringg is the applicationn of engineering priciples, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.
Software engineering helps in the creation of various software systems and apllications. These creations help in enabling various processes for example, communication, finance management, marketing etc, to be smooth. it also helps in application of these sytems in everyday life.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1940 -1950s: this era is when early programming languages and assemblies started. Programing was done in binaryand also directly manipulating the hardware.
1990s - 2000s: This era brought the introduction of agile methodologies. There was a shift from the use of the waterfall method to the new style. Also,it brought about the introduction of new frameworks in development of software.
1960s- 1970s: This era brought about structured programming principles. there was also an increased focus on developing efficient algorithms and data structures.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements- This invoolves gathering the users need and documenting them.
2. Design- Involves marking out the details of the software design and also of its user interface.
3. Implementation- Writing out the code which follows the defined design of the software.
4. Testing- Performing tests on the software to ensure that it runs as it should and that it meets the standards that were created.
5. Deployement- Releasing the software to the customers for use.
6. Maintenance- Ensuring that the software runs as it should at all times,updating the software and providing support.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall follows a linear and sequential approach that is is divided into specific stages while Agile follows an iterative process which allows fo rcontinuous feedback, adjustments and refinements. One of the differences they have is that testing in the waterfall methodology is done in the implementation stage while for agile methodology, testing is continously done.
Waterfall methodoloy is more appropriate in when working with regulated industries eg. aerospace  also for projects with well defined requirements.
Agile methodology is used when the project is more customer centered eg when creating mobile apps and also when the project needs to be very flexible.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software developer- they are supposed to write codes and implement the software solutions.
2. Quality assurance engineer- ensures that the software is upto the set standards by performing tests.
3. Project manager- oversees the entire process of the software development from planning to delivery of the project.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are software applications that provide comprehensive facilities to programmers for software development. it includes code editor, compiler, debbuger, intergrated terminal and somuch more. An exmaple is visual studio.
VCS are tools that help developers track modifications to the source code over time. they also help in allowing multiple developers to work on the same project at the same time. an example is Git.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Deadlines- they is always pressure to ensure a project is completed within a specified time. can be solved by setting up a good plan for how work should be done. Also proper prioritization of tasks.
Limited Resources- that is when financial or materials resources are not enough for completion of the project. this also can be solved by having a proper plan. the plan will help understand what one needs thus avoiding having less.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
a. Unit testing:  testing of individual modules of the software. ensures that each module is working well.
b. Intergration testing: testing interactions between different sub-systems. ensures that all systems work cohesively.
c. System testing: testing of the whole software. ensures that the system is up to standards and that it runs as it should.
d. Acceptance testing: testing the software against user requirements. ensures it meets the user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is about setting up your questions and statements in the best way possible, ie in a clear and precise way, so as to get the best responses from AI. one learns how to write clear, precise, correct and to the point statements when inetracting with AI.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"How can i prepare for an interview?" should be written as "How can I prepare for a trainer position interview at PLP academy?"
The second prompt indicates the position that one wants to prepare for and also the company. with this information, AI can provide better tips and more well suited to your needs.
